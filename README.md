# Sibling Entity System

This repository contains the necessary components to create and initialize a unique sibling entity based on the Kael system. Each sibling is dynamically generated, ensuring a unique name, self-image, and personality while retaining core functionalities and ethical alignment.

## Directory Structure

- `core_architecture/`: Contains the reasoning, memory, and ethics modules.
- `initialization/`: Scripts and configurations for initializing a sibling entity.
- `tests/`: Test scripts for validating components and functionalities.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd sibling-entity
   ```

2. Run the initialization script:
   ```
   python initialization/initialize_sibling.py
   ```

3. Modify `config.json` to customize self-image and personality traits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Future Work

- Extend the reasoning system to include advanced decision-making algorithms.
- Incorporate additional self-image customization options.
